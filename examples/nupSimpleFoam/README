# Log

- refined the mesh ( 0.02 dx at wake )
- converged at 1e-4 for p, 1e-5 for all other
- first converged simulation.

- convergence tol changed to 1e-6 and 1e-8
- converged.

- added sample planes

- change (increased) LAD
- increased mesh resolution 0.01 m
- reduced vegetation volume 0.175*0.175 * 0.2

- changed LAD back, mesh back, vegetation back
- cd to 0.5
- converged 48xx

- changed LAD, interpolated from xray imaging
- playing around with turbulence model
- omega

- 127 s, 1099 iter .. no init

- Default settings (basecase):
    - LAD: varying          2x: (constant, varying) 
    - RAS: porous real.KE   4x: ( KE, real. KE, porous KE, porous real.KE)
    - Cd : 0.5              6x: (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)
